# 13k games research.

It's been a long-time dream of mine to develop a game that fits under the 13k size limit. Currently, I have 67 partially completed JavaScript games. I want to emphasize that my intention is not to make a profit from these games, as the market is already saturated. My goal is to create cool, free, or affordable games that respect user privacy. Most of my games are missing graphics, audio, and levels. Some require code updates. However, the majority of them are over 90% complete on a code level.

At the moment I only have 12 days to finish a game and publish. 


Build a new game. Well, that may be a problem I do not have any game ideas that I did not start already.

It was my secret one of the reasons behind the hell tool was to serve one of my games as a menu. The unnamed space battle game that I working on for years now. However, that may not be pressed under 13k or if I do that should be unplayable. 

The easiest candidate is the retro ball. Without the multiplayer, it can be under 13k with high quality. And here is the question. What I do want to serve with my game. A technical demonstration with a minimal game, a perfect game with basic rules, or some balance with both?
